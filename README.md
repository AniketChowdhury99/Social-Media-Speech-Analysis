# Social-Media-Speech-Analysis
Why is it Important?
Real-world relevance: Online toxicity, misinformation, and mental health risks are global concerns.
Advanced data science: Involves NLP (Natural Language Processing), sentiment analysis, text classification, possibly toxicity detection.

Ethical Considerations:
Bias and Fairness: The model can unintentionally amplify biases present in the training data. It's crucial to test the model across different demographics to ensure fairness.
Privacy: Social media posts often contain personal data, and any analysis should respect user privacy. The dataset used here does not contain real names or sensitive data, but this must always be considered when applying these models in production.
Transparency: It's essential to explain why a particular post was classified as harmful or toxic, as this transparency fosters trust in automated systems.
Misuse Prevention: This technology should be used to aid moderation and reduce harm, not to censor legitimate expression or propagate negative bias.
